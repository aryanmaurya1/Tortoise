<h2>K-means clustering</h2>
<p>
According to wikipedia, <i>k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, 
that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), 
serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells.</i>

The problem is computationally difficult (NP-hard); however, efficient heuristic algorithms converge quickly to a local optimum.
